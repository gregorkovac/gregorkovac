My name is Gregor and I'm a computer science student.

Some basic information about me:
```
🍰 20 years old
📍 Ljubljana, Slovenia
📚 Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana
```
I've been programming for about 8 years now! I'm most interested in application and game development, competative programming, AI and machine learning. I'm very comfortable writing code in the following languages:
```
> C & C++
> Java
> HTML + CSS
> SQL
```
but I'm also well acquainted with:
```
> Python
> JavaScript
> MATLAB
> Pascal 
```

Besides programming I also enjoy:
<pre>
<code>🎸 Playing guitar and writing songs (check out my music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy12KbwRenkqWZZKQzd2NXw">here 🥰</a>)
💪 Working out
📖 Reading
☕️ Coffee <3</code>
